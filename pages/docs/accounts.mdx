# Accounts
v1.2.3 deployed to 0x0000000000009f1E546FC4A8F68eB98031846cb8

Nani Accounts is a minimal proxy factory that deploys your Nani Account. It is based on the Solady ERC4337Factory implementation and LibClone.

These deployments are deterministic using CREATE2. This means you can predict and prefund your Nani Account address without any onchain transactions.

Deployments are efficient and on L2 cost only a cent. During public beta, Accounts are sponsored.
